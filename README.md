## 🚩 The Big Problems We're Tackling

1. **Bored with books?**  
   Traditional methods are dull and slow. We add flavor with interactive, bite-sized learning experiences.

2. **Missing regional spice?**  
   Most apps ignore Indian languages. We prioritize them to make learning relevant and culturally connected.

3. **Lost in translation at work?**  
   Job seekers moving between states face language hurdles. Our app helps them communicate confidently and become more employable.
